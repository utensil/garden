## Description

Enhance the G-task golden rule in AGENTS.md to improve agent workflow and knowledge preservation. Add requirement for agents to document execution information back to completed backlog tasks, and streamline the rule for conciseness while preserving all vital information.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Add execution notes requirement to G-task rule
2. Include specific elements agents should document: key findings, reference materials (URLs/files), implementation approach, files modified, gotchas
3. Make the rule more concise while keeping all essential requirements
4. Update last modified date in AGENTS.md

## Definition of Done

- [x] G-task rule includes execution notes requirement
- [x] Rule specifies what information to document in completed tasks
- [x] Rule is concise but preserves all vital information  
- [x] Changes committed with proper [AGENT] tag
- [x] AGENTS.md last modified date updated

## Execution Notes

### Key Findings During Task
- **Original Issue**: Noticed task-1 execution notes were missing important reference material (forest repo URL)
- **Root Cause**: G-task rule didn't explicitly require documenting reference materials provided by user
- **Solution**: Enhanced G-task rule to require comprehensive execution documentation

### Implementation Approach
1. **First Enhancement**: Added execution notes requirement to G-task rule
2. **Second Enhancement**: Clarified to include "URLs, files, or external resources provided during task execution"
3. **Final Enhancement**: Made rule more concise while preserving all vital information

### Files Modified
- `/Users/utensil/projects/garden/AGENTS.md` - Enhanced G-task golden rule (3 separate commits)
- Reduced G-task rule verbosity by ~60% while maintaining all essential requirements

### Reference Materials Used
- **Task-1 Example**: Used completed task-1 as reference for what execution notes should contain
- **User Feedback**: Applied specific guidance about documenting provided reference materials

### Key Changes Made
- **Added**: Requirement to document execution notes with 6 key elements
- **Clarified**: Must include reference materials provided during execution
- **Streamlined**: Condensed verbose explanations to essential points
- **Preserved**: All vital requirements and constraints

### Gotchas for Future Tasks
- **Execution Notes Timing**: Must be added immediately after marking task Done, not before
- **Reference Material Priority**: Always document URLs/files provided by user, not just discovered materials
- **Conciseness Balance**: Keep rules brief but don't lose critical requirements
- **G-task Self-Application**: This task itself demonstrates the execution notes pattern

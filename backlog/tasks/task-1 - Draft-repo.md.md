## Execution Notes

### What Was Done
- Created comprehensive for-llm/repo.md documentation for AI agents
- Analyzed repository structure (Quartz v4 digital garden) and technology stack
- Applied forest repository structure patterns from https://github.com/utensil/forest/raw/refs/heads/main/for-llm/repo.md
- Enhanced documentation with tables, code examples, and common pitfalls

### Key Changes
- Added project overview table with key properties
- Included backlog CLI commands and project layout with emojis
- Added comprehensive common pitfalls section and code pattern references
- Included digital garden specific guidance (wikilinks, graph features)

### Files Modified
- Created `for-llm/repo.md` (240 lines) with complete agent onboarding guide

### For Future Tasks
- CustomOgImages plugin slows builds significantly
- Config file changes require full restart (not hot reload)
- Wikilinks are case-sensitive and must match exact page titles
- Use `jj` for version control, not git
